# Cone Programming Language
Cone is a fast, fit, friendly, and safe systems programming language.
It features:

- Do-it-your-way memory management
- Versatile type system (incl. variant types and slices)
- Memory, thread & type safe
- Extensive code reuse features
- Lean, native runtime
- Concise, readable syntax

The Cone compiler is currently under development.
The current status and next steps are documented in [PLAN.md][plan].

## Documentation and Other Resources

 - [Cone web site](http://cone.jondgoodwin.com)
 - [Web-based playground][playground], offering pre-built examples in a drop-down
 - [Cone Language Reference][coneref] documentation
 - [Programming Linguistics blog](http://pling.jondgoodwin.com)
 
The [Cone home repository](https://github.com/jondgoodwin/conehome)
offers a rudimentary build environment for Cone programs,
including the Congo build tool and additional example Cone programs.

## Language Features

When finished, Cone will support these features:

- Readable, modular marriage of 3D content and behavior:
  - Simple, outline-like declarative syntax for content
  - Procedural generation and behavior interwoven in content
  - Snap-together, Internet-hosted, url-located parts
- Compile-time memory, type, and concurrency safety checks
- [Gradual memory management][gmm]: safely manage memory your way
  - Lexical, single-owner strategy for performance
  - Ref-counted or tracing GC for flexibility
  - Lifetime-constrained references for performance/simplicity
  - Custom allocators (pools/arenas) for performance
- Lightweight concurrency
  - Co-routines, threads and actors
  - Lockless and locked permissions for safe data sharing
- Robust type system
  - Sum types, structs, arrays, slices, ranges, aliases
  - struct subtyping via trait, interface, & parent inheritance
  - Attach methods to any type
- Modules, macros, templates and meta-programming
- Extensible pattern matching
  - Type-defined '~~' match operator
  - 'match' blocks using custom match methods
  - Content extraction during matching
- Functions, Methods and Closures
  - Multiple return values and implicit return
  - Computed properties
- 'do' block for context management
- Concise, readable code:
  - 'this'-implied prefix operators for method cascading, etc.
  - Operator overloading
  - Control clauses for 'if', 'while', 'each'
  - Type inference
  - Parallel assignment
  - Auto-detected off-side rule
  - Blocks and 'if' are expressions
- Unicode-aware (UTF8) text strings and variable names
- Fast compilation and convenient packaging

## Building (Windows)

A Visual Studio C++ solution can be created using the Cone.vcxproj project file.
The generated object and executable files are created relative to the location of the 
solutions file. The build depends on [LLVM 7][llvm] being installed and available at $(LLVMDIR).

## Building (Linux)

To build on Linux:

	sudo apt-get install llvm-7-dev
	cmake .
	make

Note: To generate WebAssembly, it is necessary to custom-build LLVM, e.g.:

	mkdir llvm
	cd llvm
	svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk llvm-src
	cd llvm-src/tools
	svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk clang
	svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/lld/trunk lld
	cd ../..
	mkdir llvm-build
	cd llvm-build
	CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DLLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/llvm/wasm -DLLVM_EXPERIMENTAL_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=WebAssembly /llvm/llvm-src
	make
	make install

## Building (Mac OS)

To build on Mac OS:

	brew install --with-toolchain llvm
	llvm-config --bindir

CMake will auto-detect LLVM, so all you should need to do:

	cmake .
	make
